# 1. cd to your pelican theme's template directory
# 2. execute /path/to/poke.sh <base.html> <article.html>
# and the script should do the rest.
# If you do not specify base.html and article.html in the command, it will default to those, which is probably what you want
# If for some reason your theme has different names for those files, specify them in the argumenst with the first being base and second being article

# otherwise we need two, one for base and one for article, in that order
